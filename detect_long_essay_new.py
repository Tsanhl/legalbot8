    Detect if user is requesting a long essay that should be broken into parts.

    NOTE: This module is legacy/testing-only. The production implementation lives in `gemini_service.py`.
    This version is kept aligned with the current app rule:
    - Requests > 2,000 words are split into parts (max 2,000 words per part).

For best results with essays over 2,000 words, I recommend breaking this into **{suggested_parts} parts** (max 2,000 words per part):

**Suggested Approach:**
1. Ask for Part 1 (~{actual_words_per_part:,} words) - Introduction + first {suggested_parts//2 + 1} sections
2. Then ask "Continue with Part 2" for the next sections
{f"3. Then ask 'Continue with Part 3' for the remaining sections" if suggested_parts >= 3 else ""}
{f"4. Finally ask 'Continue with Part 4 - Conclusion'" if suggested_parts >= 4 else ""}

**Why break into parts?**
- The AI has memory and will continue coherently
- Each part will hit its word count accurately
- No repetitive content across parts
- Better quality and depth in each section

**Or proceed now** and I'll start with Part 1, then you can ask me to "Continue" for the rest."""
